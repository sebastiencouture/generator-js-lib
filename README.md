# generator-js-lib [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/sebastiencouture/generator-js-lib.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sebastiencouture/generator-js-lib)

> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for UMD compliant front end Javascript library including Karma test runner

## Usage

To install Yeoman from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

To install generator-js-lib from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-js-lib
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
yo js-lib
```

Boilerplate code for a UMD compliant library will be generated. The generator also facilitates the following:
1. Configures a Gruntfile for development, testing, jshint, and  distribution.
2. Configures [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) to run all tests.
3. Watches for changes and re-runs unit tests.
